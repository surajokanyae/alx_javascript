## This repository contains code samples for advanced JavaScript concepts, including:

Lexical scoping: Lexical scoping, also known as static scoping, is a scoping mechanism in which the scope of a variable is determined by the position of the variable declaration in the code.
Welcome message: A welcome message function that uses lexical scoping to display a personalized message to the user.
Closure scope chain: The closure scope chain is the chain of scopes that a closure can access. It is determined by the lexical scope of the closure's creation environment.
Closure: A closure is a function that has access to the variables in its scope, even after the scope has closed. Closures can be used to create private methods, implement callbacks, and create complex data structures.
Closure and loops: Closures can be used to create powerful loop constructs that would be difficult or impossible to implement with traditional loops.
Complex closure: A complex closure example that uses multiple closures to create a private counter.
Changing DOM with closure: A closure example that is used to change the DOM in a web application.
Private methods with closure: A closure example that is used to create private methods in a JavaScript class.
Stack order and setTimeout: An example of how the stack order and setTimeout() function can be used to create asynchronous effects in JavaScript.
